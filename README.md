    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

        I listen to the user's advice and hear what features they are asking for. Then I create user stories for each task, 
        these will have specific details for the task. These will be used to create test cases by the testers to give to the development team.
        This will help the development team develop the feature and send it back to the testers to get reviewed.
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

        I first will listen to the customer and users. Then I would use their inputs to create tasks and requirements.
        I will then organize the task on what needs to be done now, what's most important, and what can go on the backlog.
        This will help get a POC (Proof of Concept) out faster and get things started on the process without using too many resources.
        I would love to organize the task board and prioritize the task.

    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

        Being a good team member in software development means communicating, even more when you do not know something.
        Also, it means working with other members of the project in their different aspects. Understanding all the roles and
        knowing about what is happening with the project and tasks. Also being willing to help others.
